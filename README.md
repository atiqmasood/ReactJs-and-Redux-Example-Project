## mi-c3 Test Assignment (React, Redux)

This project is an attempt to accomplish what is described in the given document. Though it is a small demo projecct, I've implemented it in a way so that it can be evolved as a basis for a bigger project.

Here is the technologies and approach that I've used in this project:
- Everything is based on npm.
- npm module *create-react-app* is used to scaffold and create React Project.
- React Redux which allows to manage a state with a minimal API footprint with completely predictable behaviour.
- React Router which is the standard routing library for React.
- ES6 Syntax
- Axios Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
- CSS Framework Bootstrap
- component based styling
